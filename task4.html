    HOW	THIS	BOOK	WILL	BENEFIT	YOU
 The	entrepreneur	and	investor	Naval	Ravikant	has	said,	“To	write	a
 great	book,	you	must	first	become	the	book.”	I	originally	learned	about
 the	ideas	mentioned	here	because	I	had	to	live	them.	I	had	to	rely	on
 small	habits	to	rebound	from	my	injury,	to get stronger	in the	gym,	to
 perform at a	high	level	on	the	field,	to become	a	writer,	to	build	a
 successful	business,and	simply	to	develop	into	a	responsible	adult.
 Small	habits	helped	me	fulfill	my	potential,	and	since	you	picked	up
 this	book,	I’m	guessing	you’d	like	to	fulfill	yours	as	well.

 T
 HE	FATE	OF	British	Cycling	changed	one	day	in	2003.	The
 organization,	which	was	the	governing	body	for	professional
 cycling	in	Great	Britain,	had	recently	hired	Dave	Brailsford	as	its	new
 performance	director.	At	the	time,	professional	cyclists	in	Great	Britain
 had	endured	nearly	one	hundred	years	of	mediocrity.	Since	1908,
 British	riders	had	won	just	a	single	gold	medal	at	the	Olympic	Games,
 and	they	had	fared	even	worse	in	cycling’s	biggest	race,	the	Tour	de
 France.	In	110	years,	no	British	cyclist	had	ever	won	the	event

 FORGET	ABOUT	GOALS,	FOCUS	ON	SYSTEMS	INSTEAD
 Prevailing	wisdom	claims	that	the	best	way	to	achieve	what	we	want	in
 life—getting	into	better	shape,	building	a	successful	business,	relaxing
 more	and	worrying	less,	spending	more	time	with	friends	and	family—
 is	to	set	specific,	actionable	goals
